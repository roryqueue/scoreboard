# NBA Daily Fantasy Scoreboard Takehome

I built a simple NBA scoreboard webpage in react to complete this takehome. Upon direction, I used react hooks and the `react-hook-form` package to make the form sortable and searchable. In the interest in simplicity and time, I styled the scoreboard as minimally as possible. You can find the primary functionality in [the Scoreboard component](/components/Scoreboard.tsx).

## Run Locally

I used Node.js v16.2 to build this webpage. To run locally, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

then open localhost:3000 in the browser.
